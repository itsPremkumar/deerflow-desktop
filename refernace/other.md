Yes. I searched the current 2026 ecosystem specifically for projects that contribute **AGI/ASI-oriented architecture ideas** rather than just ordinary chat-agent features.

The most important finding is that there is **no single open-source “ASI architecture” today**. The strongest research projects each attack a different missing capability: self-evolution, lifelong memory, computer embodiment, multi-agent society, long-horizon execution, or large-scale control.

The rankings are my architectural judgment, not an official industry ranking.

# 1. A-Evolve

This is probably the **most important new project for your self-improving architecture**.

A-Evolve describes itself as universal infrastructure for self-improving agents: give it a base agent and benchmark, and it can evolve the agent using different evolution algorithms. Its current project reports experiments across MCP-Atlas, SWE-bench Verified, Terminal-Bench and SkillsBench. ([GitHub][1])

### Architecture

```text
BASE AGENT
    ↓
EVOLUTION ENGINE
    ↓
GENERATE CANDIDATES
    ↓
RUN BENCHMARKS
    ↓
SCORE
    ↓
SELECT
    ↓
ARCHIVE
    ↓
NEXT GENERATION
```

### Take from it

* universal evolver
* benchmark abstraction
* candidate/archive system
* multiple evolution algorithms
* domain-independent evolution
* zero-manual-harness target

This should become a major subsystem of your **Evolution Factory**.

---

# 2. HyperAgents

The official Meta Research HyperAgents repository describes **self-referential self-improving agents** that can optimize themselves for computable tasks. Its algorithm has a MetaAgent select a task-agent parent, modify it, evaluate it, archive the result and repeat. ([GitHub][2])

```text
            META AGENT
                │
                ▼
          SELECT PARENT
                │
                ▼
          MODIFY AGENT
                │
                ▼
             EVAL
                │
                ▼
             SCORE
                │
                ▼
            ARCHIVE
                │
                └──────► NEXT GENERATION
```

This is a critical idea because the **proposer itself is part of the optimization system**.

---

# 3. Darwin Gödel Machine

DGM takes self-improvement even further.

The research system iteratively modifies its own code, evaluates the result on coding benchmarks, and explores an evolving population/archive of agent variants. ([GitHub][3])

A useful abstraction:

```text
                    AGENT V0
                       │
               self-improvement
                       │
              ┌────────┼────────┐
              ▼        ▼        ▼
             V1       V2       V3
              │        │        │
              └────────┼────────┘
                       ▼
                    BENCHMARK
                       │
                       ▼
                    SELECT
                       │
                       ▼
                     V4
```

### What is especially valuable

DGM is not limited to:

```text
prompt improvement
```

It targets:

```text
agent code improvement
```

That is a much more powerful outer loop.

---

# 4. Continual Harness

This is one of the strongest projects for your **online self-improvement** concept.

Continual Harness allows an LLM refiner to modify the current harness during a continuous episode—including:

```text
system prompt
subagents
skills
memory
```

without resetting the task. ([GitHub][4])

Architecture:

```text
LIVE TASK
   │
   ▼
TRAJECTORY WINDOW
   │
   ▼
FAILURE DETECTION
   │
   ▼
REFINER
   │
   ├── prompt edit
   ├── subagent CRUD
   ├── skill CRUD
   └── memory modification
   │
   ▼
CONTINUE SAME EPISODE
```

That is exactly the sort of **continual adaptation** you want.

---

# 5. CORAL

CORAL is particularly interesting because it combines:

```text
multi-agent
+
persistent shared knowledge
+
isolated experiments
+
grading
+
evolution
```

Its current repository describes multi-agent self-evolution for autonomous research and supports multiple coding-agent backends, isolated workspaces, safe evaluation and shared state. It also introduced **multi-island runs**, where groups operate with isolated attempts, notes, skills and heartbeat state and can later migrate between islands. ([GitHub][5])

This is a huge idea for your architecture:

```text
                    EVOLUTION POPULATION
                           │
        ┌──────────────────┼──────────────────┐
        ▼                  ▼                  ▼
      Island A           Island B           Island C
      knowledge A        knowledge B        knowledge C
      skills A           skills B           skills C
        │                  │                  │
        └──────────────────┼──────────────────┘
                           ▼
                       COMPARISON
                           │
                           ▼
                        MIGRATION
```

This helps prevent the entire population from converging on one mediocre strategy.

---

# 6. MOSS

MOSS is especially important because it targets a deeper level of self-evolution.

Its repository describes **source-level rewriting of the agent harness itself**—including routing, hooks, state management and dispatch—rather than only modifying prompts or skills. ([GitHub][6])

Conceptually:

```text
Production Agent
      │
      ▼
Auto-Scan
      │
      ▼
Failure Batch
      │
      ▼
Code-Modification Agent
      │
      ▼
Modified Harness
      │
      ▼
Test
      │
      ▼
Deploy / Reject
```

For your architecture, this means:

```text
PROMPT EVOLUTION
        +
SKILL EVOLUTION
        +
MEMORY EVOLUTION
        +
HARNESS CODE EVOLUTION
```

rather than stopping at prompts.

---

# 7. Letta

Letta is probably the most useful reference for **persistent intelligence**.

Letta's current memory research explicitly frames agents that learn from experience around memory models and token-space memory; its production memory benchmark evaluates both memory usage and memory generation. ([Letta][7])

Letta Code's context architecture is particularly interesting:

```text
agent identity
+
persistent memory blocks
+
recall memory
+
context compilation
+
self-edited memory
+
future-self continuity
```

The agent can modify memories that affect later contexts, rather than merely storing chat transcripts. ([GitHub][8])

Architecture:

```text
                 AGENT IDENTITY
                       │
          ┌────────────┼─────────────┐
          ▼            ▼             ▼
      core memory   recall        archival
          │            │             │
          └────────────┼─────────────┘
                       ▼
                 CONTEXT COMPILER
                       │
                       ▼
                     MODEL
```

This should influence your **long-term memory layer** heavily.

---

# 8. OpenHands V1

OpenHands gives you another extremely important abstraction:

```text
Harness
+
Orchestrator
+
Control Plane
```

OpenHands itself describes the stack as three pillars: the harness (agentic loop), orchestrator (environments), and control plane (observation/orchestration at scale). ([OpenHands][9])

Its Agent SDK describes the core agent as:

```text
reasoning-action loop
tool orchestration
context management
security validation
```

with an event-driven architecture. ([GitHub][10])

And its design principles emphasize:

```text
stateless by default
one source of truth
clear boundaries
optional isolation
composable components
```

([OpenHands Docs][11])

For your architecture:

```text
AGENT
  ↓
ORCHESTRATOR
  ↓
RUNTIME ENVIRONMENT
  ↓
CONTROL PLANE
```

is a very strong separation.

---

# 9. OpenClaw

OpenClaw is still one of the most complete **persistent agent operating-system** references.

Its current architecture separates:

```text
agent-core
agent runtime
sessions
context engine
skills
tools
harness registry
provider transport
```

and its reusable `agent-core` owns the loop, harness types, messages, compaction, prompts, skills and session-storage contracts. ([GitHub][12])

Take:

```text
Gateway
Session
Context Engine
Agent Core
Harness Registry
Skills
Tools
Nodes
Automation
```

and combine them with the evolution systems above.

---

# 10. Hermes

Hermes is especially good at practical autonomous operation:

```text
persistent memory
skills as procedural memory
subagent delegation
profiles
Bot Mode
cron
background work
checkpoints
Git worktrees
trajectories
multi-provider support
```

Its current architecture documentation explicitly maps agent loop, prompt assembly, providers, tools, sessions, gateway, cron, ACP and trajectory generation. ([GitHub][13])

For your architecture, Hermes is a strong **runtime/workspace foundation**.

---

# 11. DeerFlow 2.0

DeerFlow is valuable because it packages many of the pieces into a super-agent:

```text
super-agent
+
sandbox
+
persistent memory
+
subagents
+
MCP
+
skills
+
per-thread isolation
```

Its current backend architecture uses a Gateway API, embedded LangGraph-compatible runtime, `RunManager`, `run_agent()`, `StreamBridge`, sandboxing, memory, persistence and extensible tools. ([GitHub][14])

It is especially useful as a reference for:

```text
productized super-agent architecture
```

rather than just an agent SDK.

---

# 12. Deep Agents

Deep Agents is useful as a **long-horizon agent primitive layer**.

Its architecture focuses on:

```text
planning
filesystem
subagents
middleware
tool surface
state
persistence
```

on top of LangChain/LangGraph. ([GitHub][15])

For your project:

```text
Goal
 ↓
Plan
 ↓
filesystem-backed workspace
 ↓
subagents
 ↓
persistent state
```

is extremely useful.

---

# 13. Voyager

Voyager is older than the others but remains one of the most important AGI-oriented architectural ideas.

It introduced:

```text
automatic curriculum
+
ever-growing skill library
+
environment feedback
+
execution error feedback
+
self-verification
```

for lifelong embodied learning. ([GitHub][16])

The core concept:

```text
explore
 ↓
discover behavior
 ↓
turn behavior into skill
 ↓
store skill
 ↓
reuse skill
 ↓
explore further
```

This is an excellent basis for your **skill acquisition engine**.

---

# 14. Agent Zero

Agent Zero is highly relevant to your goal of:

> “the agent should be able to do anything inside the computer.”

Its current architecture gives agents:

```text
full Linux desktop
browser DOM annotation
terminal
files
desktop apps
live documents
projects
memory
plugins
MCP
A2A
host bridge
subagents
```

([GitHub][17])

The key idea is:

```text
LLM
 ↓
full computer environment
```

rather than:

```text
LLM
 ↓
limited business APIs
```

Its memory documentation also emphasizes that persistent memory requires curation because stale or incorrect memories can cause future failures. ([GitHub][18])

---

# 15. CAMEL-AI

CAMEL is important for **agent societies**.

Its current framework contains:

```text
agents
agent societies
data generation
tools
memory
storage
benchmarks
interpreters
retrievers
runtime
human-in-the-loop
```

and explicitly supports building and studying large multi-agent societies. ([GitHub][19])

Architecture:

```text
              SOCIETY
                 │
      ┌──────────┼──────────┐
      ▼          ▼          ▼
   agent A     agent B    agent C
      │          │          │
      └──────────┼──────────┘
                 ▼
              society
                state
```

This is useful for your **AI-company architecture**.

---

# 16. Prime Agent / RLM

Prime Agent is another very interesting direction.

Its current architecture uses:

```text
daemon
worker
AgentSession
model provider
persistent IPython kernel
session storage
```

and supports persistent goals, autonomous mode, heartbeats, schedules, background sessions, subagents, session trees and RLM-style programmatic context/subagent calls. ([GitHub][20])

The powerful idea is:

```text
LLM
 ↓
persistent REPL
 ↓
state
 ↓
recursive subagents
```

instead of hundreds of isolated JSON tools.

---

# 17. Ruflo

Ruflo is interesting specifically for **specialist swarms**.

Its current documentation lists 60+ agent types and coordination approaches including:

```text
hierarchical coordinator
mesh coordinator
adaptive coordinator
collective-intelligence coordinator
```

as well as coder, reviewer, tester, planner, researcher, security and memory specialists. ([GitHub][21])

Useful concept:

```text
                  SWARM MANAGER
                       │
        ┌──────────────┼─────────────┐
        ▼              ▼             ▼
 hierarchical         mesh         adaptive
```

Don't copy 60 agents literally. Copy the **dynamic topology idea**.

---

# 18. Microsoft Agent Framework

AutoGen itself is now in maintenance mode, with Microsoft directing new projects toward Microsoft Agent Framework. MAF is positioned as the production-oriented successor with multi-agent orchestration, multi-provider support, A2A and MCP interoperability. ([GitHub][22])

That makes MAF a useful reference for:

```text
enterprise agent control
cross-runtime interoperability
A2A
MCP
multi-agent systems
```

AutoGen's older Core architecture remains historically valuable because it implemented event-driven agents, message passing and distributed runtime concepts. ([GitHub][23])

---

# 19. Self-Improving Agent Template

This one is tiny but conceptually important.

The project maintains:

```text
AGENTS.md
+
self-improving-agent skill
```

and turns repeated experience into project knowledge and new skills. ([GitHub][24])

Loop:

```text
WORK
 ↓
REFLECT
 ↓
RECORD
 ↓
NEXT TASK
```

This is the simplest implementation of a compounding intelligence loop.

---

# 20. Meta-Agent

The Canvas Meta-Agent project is another useful reference.

It deliberately separates:

```text
task system
+
meta/proposer system
+
experience archive
```

and warns about validation overfitting and the need for held-out evaluation. ([GitHub][25])

That last point is extremely important for your Evolution Factory:

```text
training/evolution benchmark
≠
final hidden benchmark
```

Otherwise your agent can simply learn the benchmark.

---

# 21. The projects I would consider truly important for your ASI architecture

If you don't have time to study 20+ projects, study these **10 deeply**:

```text
1. A-Evolve
   → universal agent evolution

2. HyperAgents
   → self-referential meta-agent

3. Darwin Gödel Machine
   → source-level recursive improvement

4. Continual Harness
   → online/reset-free adaptation

5. CORAL
   → population/island evolution

6. Letta
   → durable experiential memory

7. OpenHands
   → harness/orchestrator/control plane

8. OpenClaw
   → persistent agent runtime/Gateway

9. Hermes
   → skills + delegation + practical autonomy

10. Voyager
   → lifelong skill acquisition
```

Then layer in:

```text
DeerFlow
Deep Agents
Agent Zero
CAMEL
Prime Agent
Ruflo
Microsoft Agent Framework
```

---

# 22. The ASI architecture you can synthesize from them

This is the architecture I would build after studying all of them:

# 24. One additional project category you should study closely

There is now a recognizable **“self-improving agents” research ecosystem**, not just isolated projects. The maintained Awesome Self-Improving Agents index currently lists 2026 work including:

```text
RoboPhD
Group-Evolving Agents
HyperAgents
CORAL
Adaptive Auto-Harness
MOSS
Recursive Self-Evolving Agents via Held-Out Selection
Continual Harness
Argus
```

([GitHub][26])

That is significant because your project should not treat “self-improvement” as one feature.

It should be an **entire subsystem**.

---

# 25. My final architecture recommendation for you

Use five evolutionary levels:

```text
LEVEL 1
Memory learning

LEVEL 2
Skill learning

LEVEL 3
Strategy/planner learning

LEVEL 4
Harness evolution

LEVEL 5
Meta-harness evolution
```

And five persistent layers:

```text
PERSONAL MEMORY
PROJECT MEMORY
WORLD MODEL
TRAJECTORY MEMORY
EVOLUTION ARCHIVE
```

And five execution layers:

```text
AGENT
→ TOOL
→ COMPUTER
→ SANDBOX
→ WORLD
```

And five intelligence layers:

```text
MODEL
→ AGENT
→ TEAM
→ SUPERVISOR
→ META-AGENT
```

Put those together and the conceptual target is:

```text
               MODEL
                 ↓
               AGENT
                 ↓
              AGENTS
                 ↓
               TEAM
                 ↓
            SUPERVISOR
                 ↓
             EXECUTIVE
                 ↓
            META-AGENT
                 ↓
          EVOLUTION FACTORY
                 ↓
            BETTER HARNESS
                 ↓
             BETTER AGENT
                 ↓
             BETTER TEAM
                 ↓
          BETTER META-AGENT
```

That is the **most interesting AGI/ASI-oriented architecture direction I would recommend studying in September 2026**. The critical caveat is that recursive self-improvement is an active research area and can produce benchmark overfitting, regressions, or unsafe behavior; the current research itself emphasizes held-out evaluation, isolation and controlled promotion. ([GitHub][25])

For your specific project, the strongest combination is **OpenClaw/Hermes for the persistent agent kernel, OpenHands/DeerFlow/Deep Agents for execution and orchestration, Letta/Voyager for learning and memory, and A-Evolve/HyperAgents/DGM/Continual Harness/CORAL/MOSS for the recursive evolution layer**.
