"""10. Cross-thread recall + Dreaming trigger.

Wraps memory.dreaming (light/REM/deep sleep phases) + active_memory with
an explicit opt-in recall config. No change to default per-user isolation:
recall across threads is off unless CrossThreadRecallConfig.enabled is
True for that agent/user. The trigger helper lazily imports dreaming so
this module stays import-light for Gateway workers.
