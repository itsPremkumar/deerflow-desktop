    ## Prerequisites & Dependencies
    - Redis server running on localhost:6379
    - aioredis package installed
    
    ## Architecture
    - Modular CacheService interface
    - Graceful fallback to database when cache misses
    
    ## Security
    - All cache keys hashed with project prefix
    - No plaintext secrets stored in cache
    
    ## Verification Plan & Automated Tests
    - Run pytest tests/test_cache.py -v
    - Capture performance benchmarks before and after
